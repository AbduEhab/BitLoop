# NeoHex
This is an abandoned project. NeoHex.co is no longer under my management. 

This was an old prototype for the company's website.

Please stop messaging me about code details for I have distanced myself from web development since forever at this point. I have answered all the questions that I was able to and will keep this repo up for thoes who'd like to look at it.

If anyone would like to volunteer and add comments to some lines of code to help those who stumble upon this repo, create a pull request and I'll check it out.
